            Hey there! I'm <strong>Diggity Dog</strong>, the passionate treasure-hunting enthusiast behind <strong>Beep & Dig</strong>. My love for metal detecting ignited on the shores of Lake Michigan, where that first exhilarating "beep" revealed a rusty old coin—igniting a lifelong obsession. Now, I'm here to share the thrill of uncovering hidden relics, from glistening lost jewelry to Michigan's legendary copper nuggets, with you.
